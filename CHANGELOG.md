- Python path variable scope

## [Released] - 2.6.10 2020-05-01

### Changed

- Made the Mypy internal error detection less picky
- Adjusted to change of MyPy 0.770

## [Released] - 2.6.9 2020-01-08

### Changed

- Run mypy with CWD set to the directory of the configuration file if provided (To allow relative path defined in the configuration file to work as expected).

- Use path.delimiter instead of hard coded ':' (Windows path separator is ';')

### Added

- New setting to define PYTHONPATH
- User friendly message to guide a user which does not have the required module 'typed-ast' installed.

### Fixed

### Changed

- Use the new cli parameter "[--show-absolute-path](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_line.html#cmdoption-mypy-show-absolute-path)" added in MyPy 0.750 to avoid relying on a black magic trick of setting CWD to root when calling MyPy to obtain full file path.

 - Note: CWD must still be set at root due to one last reason â€” [Mypy Bug2974](https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/2974).
