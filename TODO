### Bug

* Need to find a way to prevent hundreds of false Issues in atom.
 * They all points to mypy files with invalid paths like:
   * &lt;workspace&gt;/usr/local/lib/mypy/&lt;path&gt;/&lt;filename&gt;.pyi
 * The solution is probably going to require change to init.coffee:135-136:
      ```
      for key, val of lines
          result = result + path.join(rootPath, val) + os.EOL
      ```
 * The solution is probably going to require change to init.coffee:167-169:
      ```
       #HACK: Work around false positive of "mypy --disallow-subclassing-any"
       if msg.filePath.endsWith("/lib/mypy/typeshed/stdlib/3/types.pyi")
         return
      ```
